            Nothing beats curling up on a comfortable chair, 
            sitting across from a fireplace, with a cat/dog at your lap,
             hot coffee within arm's reach, and reading a book.<br/> If this sounds
              like a good way to spend some time, ensure the book you read is one 
              of the following highly-rated best sellers written by Osomhe 
              himself!
